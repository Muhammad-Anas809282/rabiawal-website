                    Allah protected His sacred house by sending flocks of birds (Ababil) that pelted the army with
                    stones of baked clay, as mentioned in Surah Al-Fil. This divine protection occurred in the same year
                    our beloved Prophet ﷺ was born, signifying the importance of his coming into this world.
